# WebPush  Setup

In order to enable WebPush support in `cisidm` you need to add the `webpush` configuration block to your config-file.
For this, you need to generate a valid [VAPID (Voluntary Application Server Identification)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-webpush-vapid-01)
key pair.
