# Documentation

Welcome the `cisidm` documentation.

**Check the navigation bar on the left for an overview of available guides and references.**

:::warning Work-In-Progress
The documentation of `cisidm` has just begun. A lot of pages, examples and guides are not yet available but might appear in the navigation bar because we're already planning which content is important for the first release of the docs.

---

If you feel comfortable with using `cisidm`, please consider contributing to either the source code, the documentation or both! :rocket:

If you still feel brave enough to test out cisidm or start contributing, checkout out our [**Getting Started Guide**](/guides/getting-started.md) which will walk you through a simple docker-compose based setup to secure your applications and services.
